Add the python files to your project file to look like the image below

Thinking about removing adminstersLINK, sessionHUB, and measuresLINK and just haveing sessionLINK with an ID for each session - maybe keep session hub off of it with a description of sorts

List of tables that still need to be populated: EndpointUnitLINK, DataSourceLINK, DataTypeLINK, (AdministersLINK, MeasuresLINK, SessionHUB / what we decide to keep change) + experimetnal goal and hypothesis (honestly thugh these can be empty)
